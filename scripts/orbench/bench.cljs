;; orbench — can a free OpenRouter model port a Clojure decision core to .kotoba?
;;
;; The grade is not a judge model. It is the real compiler:
;;   1. `kotoba -M check`   — does it compile at all
;;   2. `kotoba -M inspect` — are the exports/param-types the requested interface
;;   3. `kotoba -M test`    — does the battery pass on :jvm-kir AND :js AND :wasm
;;   4. `kotoba -M compile --target aarch64-macos` — is it native-qualified
;;
;; `validate` proves the gate discriminates in both directions before any model
;; is called: every battery must pass on the landed reference and must fail on a
;; one-token mutation of it. A battery that cannot fail is not measuring.
